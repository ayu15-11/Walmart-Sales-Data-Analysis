# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis
This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We use Python for data cleaning and processing, SQL (MySQL ) for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to address key business challenges.
📌 Project Goals
✅ Clean and preprocess raw sales data
✅ Load cleaned data into relational databases
✅ Write SQL queries to solve real-world business problems
✅ Document all steps for reproducibility and future improvements
